# Finetuning Large Language Models

This repository contains code and examples from the [Finetuning Large Language Models ↗](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/) course by DeepLearning.AI.

## Course Overview

Chapters:

0. Introduction
1. Why finetune
2. Where finetuning fits in
3. Instruction finetuning
4. Data preparation
5. Training process
6. Evaluation and iteration
7. Consideration on getting started now
8. Conclusion

In this course you will learn:

- When to apply finetuning on large language models (LLMs)
- How to prepare data for finetuning
- How to train and evaluate an LLM on your data

With finetuning, you can update the weights of an LLM neural network on new data, customizing the model for your specific needs.
